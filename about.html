            <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <p>In 1985 in a small 3,000 sq. ft. building, Bailey's Discount Center was opened. Mark Bailey (21 years old), his brother Matt (15 years old and still in high school), and their father Beecher began to fill this small building in an obscure location with any bargain they could find. The biggest challenge in the beginning was trying to build the connections to find the product.</p>
            <p>Through the first few years the process was slow, but then the visits to all the trade shows and telephone calls looking for closeouts started to pay off. Manufacturers liked Bailey's out of the way location because they could sell their closeouts at a discounted price and not upset their regular customers.</p>
            <p>As the Bailey's reputation grew so did their buildings. The original block building that is located southwest of the present location received a major overhaul and a large addition, which made a total of 10,000 sq. ft. of space. It didn't take long before they were out of room again. With no room left at this location to add on, the decision was made to purchase the land directly north across highway 10.</p>
            <p>In November of 1991 the grand opening of the new 24,000 sq. ft. building took place. The customers loved the new location. With so many items to look at people began driving from further locations. The building that seemed impossible to outgrow was soon too small. Within the next few years 2 major expansions were undertaken, bringing the total sq. ft. to nearly 100,000. What had started out as a dream had become a reality.</p>
            <p>In September of 2004 the new and present location was opened. This massive structure is 200,000 sq. ft., has 10 rental shops in the foyer, air conditioning, and a large expo center. This unbelievable growth has been achieved because of the thousand of loyal friends that have shopped with us for years.</p>
            <p>Who knows what new and exciting things will happen in the future but one thing is for sure, we will never waiver from the original plan to give our customers quality products at unbeatable prices.</p>
